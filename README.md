# Project Description
This was my first simple python code, using what i had started learning to create a mini game. In this mini game the user has to guess which number a roll will be and the code register the scores. The game will then ask the user if it wants to continue the game or stop, if the user does not input variations of yes (yes, y, ye, s, si, sim), the game ends.
